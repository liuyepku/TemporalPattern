	* complete rewrite of DAL kernel

2001-11-05  Frank Hoeppner  <frank.hoeppner@ieee.org>

	* cells.cpp, cells.hpp, iterator.cpp: Input and output files can
	be specified explicitly via "data<input.ddl>output.tab", where
	input.ddl is the input file and output.tab the output file.

	* datatype.cpp: selections from DDL fields are also possible, a
	selection index of 0 leads to a constant attribute value 1

2001-10-15  Frank Hoeppner  <frank.hoeppner@ieee.org>

	* fcm.cpp, cells.cpp, iterator.cpp, dal.hpp: Replaced MULTILOOP by
	DELAYED bit. SHARED state is automatically removed for
	DELAYED+WRITEBACK data. (See also comments [DELAYED].)

	* sample.cpp: Added (hierarchical) indentation for grid sampling
	(every full iteration in first dimension in separate data
	collection).

2001-10-12  Frank Hoeppner  <frank.hoeppner@ieee.org>

	* sample.cpp: Added GRID mode (replaces functionality of mesh
	program in fc package).

2001-10-08  Frank Hoeppner  <frank.hoeppner@ieee.org>

	* access.cpp: empty lines in tables without hierarchies have
	hierarchy level 1, non-empty lines 2. This enables minimal
	hierarchical operations with flat table files.

2001-10-05  Frank Hoeppner  <frank.hoeppner@ieee.org> (0.1.4)

	* access.cpp, access.hpp, iterator.cpp, cells.cpp: buffered
	iterator was not yet able to handle mark/rewind. Fixed.

2001-08-29  Frank Hoeppner  <frank.hoeppner@ieee.org>

	* fc.cpp: bugfix in algorithm by Gustafson and Kessel (center
	vector of previous iteration has been used for update covariance
	matrix; now center vector of current iteration is used)

2001-07-22  Frank Hoeppner  <frank.hoeppner@ieee.org> (0.1.3)

	* adopted to new logtrace version

2001-06-07  Frank Hoeppner  <frank.hoeppner@ieee.org>

	* access.cpp: In a .tab file, the last line marked by '#' contains
	the header information (not the first). This has been changed to
	be compatible with other programs, like gnuplot for instance.

2001-04-11  Frank Hoeppner  <frank.hoeppner@ieee.org>

	* dal.hpp, content.cpp, cells.cpp, access.hpp, access.cpp, id.cpp,
	iterator.cpp: new file types ".ddl-l" and ".tab-l" for lists of
	".ddl" and ".tab" files. Every word in the list file will be used
	as a filename (extension will be added automatically), all these
	files will be read consecutively, as if the data therein would be
	in a single file. Currently, mark/rewind is NOT supported for
	these files! These files are read-only, if you produce some output
	using a list file as input, the output will be written into a
	conventional ".ddl" or ".tab" file.
	
	* sample.cpp: changed random number handling in sub_sampling(),
	random seed initialized via seconds since 1970

2001-04-10  Frank Hoeppner  <frank.hoeppner@ieee.org> (0.1.2)

	* first pre-release

2001-02-01  Frank Hoeppner  <frank.hoeppner@ieee.org>

	* Introduced index of collection to synchronize collections whose
	fields comes from multiple files.
